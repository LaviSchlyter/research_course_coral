# Coral Reef introduction ot data 

Author: Lavinia Schlyter
Version: 1.0

This repo is a succession/subsection of the Coral Reef repo but intended to be more reproducible as part of the course "Introduction to research" at EPFL. It will take several scripts from the original folder and make them such that they are more reproducible and follow coding conventions.
